        <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
    <p style="line-height: 40px; color: white; font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"  >Climate change is a global threat. The increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs—carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere are blamed for the changing global climate. The greenhouse gases play a key role in causing climate change, and the biosphere can contribute positively as well as negatively to the atmospheric GHG concentrations through feedback processes. Knowledge of the feedback processes and their interactions with climate change and human activities is necessary if we are to understand to what impact feedback processes will have on climate change and to what extent manipulation of the biosphere will actually have the desired beneficial effects. In this context, a significant amount of scientific research work has been done and is continuing across different parts of the world to characterize the sources and sinks of GHGs. Thus, the book entitled, ‘Greenhouse Gas Emissions,’ is a compilation of select case studies on the topic authored by international scientists from different parts of the world.</p>

        <h1 style="color: yellow; text-align: center;">WHAT IS GREEN EMISSION GASES
            <p style="color: white;">Greenhouse gases (also known as GHGs) are gases in the earth's atmosphere that trap heat. During the day, the sun shines through the atmosphere, warming the earth's surface. At night the earth's surface cools, releasing heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p></h1>

        <h1 style="color: yellow; text-align: center;">CAUSES
            <p style="color: white;">Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil puts more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. NASA has observed increases in the amount of carbon dioxide and some other greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Too much of these greenhouse gases can cause Earth's atmosphere to trap more and more heat. This causes Earth to warm up.

                Methane (CH4)
                Nitrous oxide (N2O)
                Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)

        <h1 style="color: yellow; text-align: center;">HOW TO OVERCOME WITH THIS PROBLEM
            <p style="color: white;">Get a home energy audit.
                Use Renewable energy.
                Purchase Solar Panels.
                Buy Green Tags.
                Purchase Carbon offsets.
                Adjust your thermostat.
                Install solar lights.
                Use energy-saving light bulbs.Planting more trees: Trees use carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, for photosynthesis
                Reducing deforestation
                Reducing the consumption of fossil fuels
                Conserving energy
                Switching to renewable sources of energy: Such as solar, wind, and hydro power
                Reducing, reusing, and recycling
                Supporting sustainable agriculture
                Conserving water</p></h1>

        <h2>What are the different Greenhouse Gases that are causing Global Warming?</h2>
        <p>Human actions (most notably the combustion of fossil fuels) have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in global warming. These greenhouse gases are:</p><br>
        <ul class="style">
            <li>1.) Water vapor (H2O)</li>
            <li>2.) Carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>
            <li>3.) Methane (CH4)</li>
            <li>4.) Nitrous oxide (N2O)</li>
            <li>5.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs and HCFCs)</li>
            <li>6.) Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>
            <li>7.) Perfluorocarbons</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>The impact of any greenhouse gas on the temperature of the Earth is determined by its chemical composition and relative concentration in the atmosphere. Some gases have a great capacity for absorbing infrared light and are found in large quantities. Others have much lower absorption capabilities and are only found in trace amounts.</p><br>
        <h2>1. Water Vapor</h2><br>
        <p>Although water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, it behaves differently than other greenhouse gases. This is because the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is largely determined by air temperatures rather than by human behavior. Therefore higher the rate of evaporation of water from the surface, the warmer it is. As a result of enhanced evaporation, the lower atmosphere has a higher concentration of water vapor. This water vapor is capable of absorbing infrared radiation and radiating it back to the surface and trapping more heat.</p><br>
        <h2>2. Carbon dioxide</h2><br>
        <p>Between 1959 and 2006, CO2 levels in the atmosphere increased by an average of 1.4 parts per million (ppm) every year, and nearly 2.0 ppm per year between 2006 and 2018.</p><br>
        <h2>3. Natural Sources</h2><br>
        <ul class="style">
            <li>1.) Volcanic outgassing</li>
            <li>2.) Organic matter burning</li>
            <li>3.) Natural decay</li>
            <li>4.) Aerobic (oxygen-using) organisms’ respiration</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2>4. Fluorinated gases</h2><br>
        <p>CFCs, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons are two more trace gases created that have greenhouse effects (PFCs). Fluorinated gases are responsible for 0.34 watts per square meter of radiative forcing. Nitrous oxide is responsible for 0.16 watts per square meter. Because of natural biological interactions in soil and water, nitrous oxides have low background concentrations. Whereas fluorinated gases are virtually completely derived from industrial sources.</p><br>
        <h2>How is the world trying to tackle the Greenhouse Gases Emission ?</h2><br>
        <p>The attempt to combat global climate change should include growth objectives for greenhouse gas emissions. This should propose a method for choosing suitable goals for developing and developed nations. Therefore, they should neither be so restrictive that they stifle economic growth nor should they be so loose that they result in massive windfall gains. Even though the maximum emissions have been done by the developed countries, without the cooperation of developing nations, we would not be able to tackle the climate change challenge.</p><br>
        <h2>Why are developing nations essential for emission reduction of greenhouse effect?</h2><br>
        <p>
            Firstly, a global problem needs a worldwide solution. The situation is essentially one in which a single country can only make limited progress. Therefore, a successful solution needs the participation of all countries. 

            Emissions from emerging nations are growing at the fastest rate and will overtake those from developed countries. As a result, without the cooperation of emerging economies, carbon reductions will be ineffective in combating climate change.
            
            If emerging nations refuse to join the international framework, their emissions might climb much higher than expected. For instance, for every ton of carbon emissions lowered by industrialized countries, emissions in developing countries may increase by a quarter ton.</p><br>
            <h2>A Conclusion About Greenhouse Effect</h2><br>
            <p>
                Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to climb for decades to come, owing in major part to greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. The environment has already been affected by global climate change. Glaciers have receded, ice on rivers and lakes has melted, plant and animal ranges have altered, and trees have begun to bloom earlier.

                Let us not waste more time and start focusing on our emissions and spread awareness about climate change due to greenhouse gases.</p><br>
